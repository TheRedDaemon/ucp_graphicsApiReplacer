general: Graphics API Replacer
general_descr: "This module allows to switch the displaying system to a more modern that uses either DirectX or OpenGL, which should provide a better experience, for example with recording software.
Note, that the rendering itself is still done by the CPU, so performance gains should not be expected.

The window resolution is set via this options, while the in-game options decide the render resolution. The display-ratio is based on the in-game resolution, which may product black bars that will show up on recordings."

window: Window Options
window_descr: General options related to the window.

window.type: Mode
window.type_descr: The type of window mode to use.
window.type_window: Window
window.type_borderlessWindow: Borderless Window
window.type_borderlessFullscreen: Borderless Fullscreen

window.width: Width 
window.width_descr: The pixel width of the game window.

window.height: Height
window.height_descr: The pixel height of the game window.

window.pos: Position
window.pos_descr: Decides the (start) position of the window.
window.pos_middle: Middle
window.pos_topLeft: Top Left
window.pos_bottomLeft: Bottom Left
window.pos_topRight: Top Right
window.pos_bottomRight: Bottom Right

window.continueOutOfFocus: Continue Out-Of-Focus
window.continueOutOfFocus_descr: Sets how the game handles losing focus.
window.continueOutOfFocus_pause: Pause
window.continueOutOfFocus_continue: Continue
window.continueOutOfFocus_render: Continue and Render

graphic: Graphics API Options
graphic_descr: Options for DirectX and OpenGL.

graphic.api: Graphics API
graphic.api_descr: The graphics API to use.
graphic.api_DirectX: DirectX 11
graphic.api_OpenGL: OpenGL (Deprecated)

graphic.filterLinear: Filter Linear
graphic.filterLinear_descr: A linear texture filter is applied. Might improve picture if window and render resolution is not equal.

graphic.vsync: VSync
graphic.vsync_descr: Activates VSync. Caps number of rendered frames to display frequency. Has effect on map scrolling, since it is partially frame dependent.

graphic.waitWithGLFinish: Wait with glFinish
graphic.waitWithGLFinish_descr: Calls glFinish after screen buffer swap if OpenGL is used. Might have no effect whatsoever. Possible subject of removal.

graphic.pixFormat: Pixel Format
graphic.pixFormat_descr: Pixel color format. Transformed to 32 bit RGBA anyway, but sets the software renderer option. ARGB1555 is likely the native texture format.
graphic.pixFormat_argb1555: ARGB1555
graphic.pixFormat_rgb565: RGB565

graphic.debug: API Debug
graphic.debug_descr: Activates debug messages. Should be off for normal usage. At least in case of DirectX it requires Debug libraries.
graphic.debug_none: None
graphic.debug_enabled: Enabled (Reduced output for OpenGL)
graphic.debug_debugContextEnabled: Create OpenGL debug context

control: Control
control_descr: Options for input control.

control.clipCursor: Clip Cursor
control.clipCursor_descr: Clips the cursor to the game part of the window in general, which will otherwise only happen with a hold mouse button.

control.scrollActive: Scroll
control.scrollActive_descr: Border scrolling is active.

control.margin: Scroll Margin
control.margin_descr: Window pixels to extend the scroll zone outward for window modes without active clipper.

control.padding: Scroll Padding
control.padding_descr: Window pixels to extend the scroll zone inward.
